### Problem 
Your awesome little Samsung Gear VR Camera records all videos like this:

    C88888D C888888888888D C8888888888                                                     
    88888d88b. 8888888888 .d88b.888888        
    8888P        888888         8. 888          
    888           88888           8 88           
    888           88888           88 8            
    8888         8888888         8'888          
    888`Y8  8P' 8 8888 8 `Y88P'  88888                                      
    C88888D C888888888 888D C888888888 

But Autopano Video Pro needs them as *two separate* videos, like this: 

    888D C8888888888      888D C8888888888                                               
    88888d8888888899      88888d8888888899    
    88.8       8.988      88.8       8.988    
    888         8988      888         8988     
    888         8988      888         8988     
    88`8       8'988      88`8       8'988    
    88888Y88P8888888      88888Y88P8888888                                
    8888D C888888888      8888D C888888888

### Solution 

  - ```Make sure you have ffmpeg installed on your computer: https://ffmpeg.org/```
  - ```put the splitter.sh file in the same folder as all your Samsung Gear 360 videos```
  - ```CD into that directory and type "chmod +x splitter.sh"```
  - ``` Then type "./splitter.sh"```
  - - ```Whew. Go get some rest. You deserve it. ```
